# Tic-tac-toe

## This game was developed as part of my CS50AI course. On the frontend, pygame is used to create the graphics and GUI. The backend enables a human to make moves and calculates the optimum move for an AI to play. The algorithm employed is minimax with alpha-beta pruning. 


### Gamplay

#### This is the home page, where a human can choose to play as X or O, if one chooses O they play second, X goes first.
